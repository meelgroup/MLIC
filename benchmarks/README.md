# More datasets

Find the full set of datasets from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HFAxx1jM9mvnXscXXso5OR9OdoJL0ZWs?usp=sharing).
This link contains two subfolders: converted_for_orange_library and quantile_based_discretization. converted_for_orange_library contains datasets that can directly be passed to `imli.discretization_orange()` subroutine. This subroutine discretize a dataset based of entropy based discretization approach. 

The datasets inside quantile_based_discretization subdirectory can ge passed to `imli.discretization()` subroutine that applies quantile based discretization.
