    "We now create an instance of `imli` object. First we learn a classification rule in CNF, that is, the decision rule is ANDs of ORs of input features. For that, we specify `rule_type=CNF` inside the model. In this example, we learn a 2 clause rule with parameter `data_fidelity=10`. `data_fidelity` parameter sets the priority between accuracy and rule-sparsity such that a higher value of `data_fidelity` results in a more accurate rule. We require a MaxSAT solver to learn the Boolean rule. In this example, we use `open-wbo` as the MaxSAT solver. "
